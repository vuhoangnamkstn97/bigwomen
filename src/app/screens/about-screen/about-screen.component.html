      The definition of beauty has continued to expand, making room for women of
      colors, obese women, or women with freckles. We are moving toward a
      culture of big-tent beauty. One in which everyone is welcome. Everyone is
      charming. Everyoneâ€™s idealized version can appear in the Big Women
      Collection
