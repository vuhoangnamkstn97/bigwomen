      The MetaVixens collection is an exclusive NFT project created with love by
      Romanian illustrator theinkedmink(Ana). Each MetaVixen is one of a kind
      and hand drawn, inspired by various elements, some even by mythology or
      pop culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each one is completely unique, not just by appearance, but also by
      personality and passion points, which is a statement to the versatility
      and power of every woman. The project combines Anaâ€™s love for character
      design with the desire to address woman empowerment and its importance
      throughout the metaverse.
